# Feeltech FY6600 15/30/50/60MHz Series

Based on the discussion in:

https://www.eevblog.com/forum/testgear/feeltech-fy6600-60mhz-2-ch-vco-function-arbitrary-waveform-signal-generator/

This Git will be the placeholder for the following topics:
- Reverse engineering of the protocol between the front panel controller and the FPGA which generates DAC stream for wave generation.
- Reverse engineering of the schematics
- Writing new software for the people with nicely bricked devices with no support from the maker Feeltech. Also getting rid of the ugly chinese fonts used on these devices.
